    <h2 id="core-vision">What is the core vision?</h2>
    <p>A fully extensible and open source launcher for hackers, creators and
    dabblers. It comes with sane defaults to make it useful out of the box. But
    everything can be changed to fit your needs. Don't let others tell you the
    best way to be productive, configure it to be perfect for you.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="compare">How do you compare to alternatives?</h2> <p>Zazu treats
    plugins as first class citizens. Even the app finder is built as a plugin
    which can be replaced (if desired). This means plugins are designed as
    natural extensions of Zazu and they don't require a special trigger such as
    <code>/</code> or <code>,</code>. This allows a more intuitive plugin API that doesn't hamper
    discoverability.</p> <p>Zazu is a cross platform app launcher that supports
    Linux, Mac and Windows. Every build is tested on all three platforms. This
    helps ensure it works perfectly when you download it, and has a consistent
    experience when you switch between Operating Systems.</p> <p>Zazu is open
    source licensed under a permissive MIT license. If the calculator is missing
    an important feature, make a pull request! If you hate this one thing about
    Zazu that would totally make it better, fork it!</p> <p>All <a
    href="/documentation/configuration/">configuration</a> is in a single text
    file. It can be backuped and versioned so you can have a consistent
    experience.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="platform-support">Does it work on &lt;PLATFORM&gt;?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Zazu works on Linux, Mac and Windows!</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="can-make-plugins">Can I make my own plugins?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely! Zazu is designed with extensibility in mind. Want something
    custom to help with your job? We have a <a
        href="/documentation/plugins/">tutorial</a> to help make your first Zazu
      plugin.</p>
    <p>Don't need a calculator? Get rid of it from your <a
      href="/documentation/configuration/">configuration</a> file. Need a
    snappier file finder? Swap out the default!</p>

    <h2 id="how-fast-is-it">How fast is it?</h2>
    <p>I have not officially benchmarked it. My friends and I use it every day
    and it is quite snappy. If a plugin feels sluggish to you let me know, I'd
    love to help you make it faster. If you already know what the problem is,
    feel free to open a pull request, I'd love to have some help. :)</p>
