### Bugs

There were quite a few bugs that were fixed. For example if you ever tried
narrowing down your plugin logs in the debugger, it wasn't working as correctly,
but it's fixed now.

We also made `npm` more resilient, yet again!

### Features

We are introducing a new block type [Preview][preview] which allows you to
display large text on the screen, compared to a small notification. This would
be useful for presentations, or for more accessible communications.

We fixed quite a few more bugs and added a few more features, be sure to check
out the [changelog][changelog] for information on the rest of the bugs.
